## General Info

Ah, the sweet pitter-patter of rain on a 8.6 oz Silpoly rain tarp. This ultralight hexagonal rain tarp is the perfect companion for your next hammock camping adventure. While most ultralight tarps are made from 1.1 oz Silnylon that stretches when wet, ours is made from a newly developed 0.9 oz Silpoly to be able to deliver a crazy light, full coverage tarp that will not mist through or stretch.

Sleep comfortably knowing you are high and dry while the sound of the rain puts you to sleep. Includes a tube of Sil-Net for sealing seams.
